A working example for [kotlin-rpc](https://github.com/krzema12/kotlin-rpc).

# How to run

```
# TODO: remove the need to build the API module first.
# Ideally it should be possible to just build the parent project and the API module should be built automatically.
# See https://github.com/krzema12/kotlin-rpc/issues/7
./gradlew :api:build
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```
